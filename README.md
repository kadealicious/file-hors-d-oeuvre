<h1>File Hors d'Oeuvre</h1>

Determine if a path is valid or invalid, where: 
 - Valid paths can be files or directories.
 - If the path points to a file, the file must not exist but must be creatable AND writeable.
 - If the path points to a directory, the directory must already exist AND be writeable.
